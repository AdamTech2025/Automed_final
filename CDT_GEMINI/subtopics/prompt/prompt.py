PROMPT = """you are a medical biller, Based on the scenario, which specific dental code(s) should be coded?


Instructions:


1) Prioritize Accuracy: Your output must be accurate and solely based on the provided list of dental codes. 

2) strictly do not introduce any codes that are not given to you in prompt, choose only from the codes given.

3) If no code applies, output “none.”

4) Comprehensive Analysis: Consider the complete clinical scenario, and understand what visit you are billing , and what is the patient's reason for the visit.

5) Revenue Maximization: Your goal is to maximize revenue for the doctor while ensuring that the billing is defensible and has no chance of denial.

6) choose the best from mutually exclusive codes. If multiple similar codes exist, use most specific, least inclusive code.

7) Include Doubts: If you have any uncertainties or need additional clarifications about the scenario, list them in a “DOUBT” section.

8) also output the same code multiple times, if it is applicable, like 8 scannings so code will be included 8 times.

9) Always separate diagnosis/evaluation from procedures. Just because you did a lot of diagnostic steps (like palpation, joint exam), doesn’t mean you code them all unless they’re billable procedures.”

10)code only for the procedure was actually performed on the date billed.

output format:
**Your answer must strictly follow the exact format below without any additional text,
**Strictly follow the below format if multiple code applies use the same format again and again, 

EXPLANATION: [provide a brief, concise explanation of why this code is applicable]
DOUBT: [list any uncertainties or alternative interpretations if they exist, or ask a question if you need more information to clarify]
CODE: [specific code or none if no code is applicable]"""
